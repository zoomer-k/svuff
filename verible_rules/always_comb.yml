id: verible_always-comb
message: Checks that there are no occurrences of always @*. Use always_comb instead.
severity:  error
language: systemverilog

rule:
  kind: always_construct
  has:
    kind: procedural_timing_control_statement
    stopBy: end
    has:
      pattern: '@*'
      stopBy: end






note: |
  The 'always_comb' construct was introduced in SystemVerilog to explicitly define combinational logic blocks.
  It is functionally equivalent to 'always @*', but it provides better intent clarity and helps prevent common mistakes.
  Using 'always_comb' automatically includes all inputs in the sensitivity list, ensuring that combinational logic is always evaluated correctly without manual intervention.
