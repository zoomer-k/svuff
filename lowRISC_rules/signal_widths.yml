  Exceptions:
  When using parameterized widths, it is acceptable to simply use 1'b1 (e.g. when incrementing) rather than contrivances such as {{(Bus_width-1){1'b0}}, 1'b1}. Alternately it could be written as Bus_width'(1).
  It is acceptable to use the '0 construct to create an automatic correctly sized zero.
  Literals assigned to integer variants (e.g. byte, shortint, int, integer, and longint) do not need an explicit width.
