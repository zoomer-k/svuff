note: |
  Designs that mix blocking and non-blocking assignments for registers simulate incorrectly because some simulators process some of the blocking assignments in an always block as occurring in a separate simulation event as the non-blocking assignment. 
  This process makes some signals jump registers, potentially leading to total protonic reversal. That's bad.
